IPv4 Addresses
==============

The Hacklab has an assignment of IPv4 addresses. These are a limited resource.


Assignment to members
---------------------

Members may receive assignments of any number of IPv4 address from the pool of
available addresses. This assignment must be returned to the available address
pool when a membership period is ended (but not while suspended).

There is no charge for this service. Members may return their assignments at
any time.

Exhaustion of available addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are no available addresses and the assignment of an IPv4 address is
required by a member with no addresses, then the member with the most additional
addresses (or volunteers with additional addresses) will be given N months notice
to return enough additional addresses to meet the assignment need.

If all members with addresses only have one IPv4 address each then there are no
more addresses and a first come first served queue should be started.


Assignment to the Hacklab
-------------------------

When the Hacklab requires IPv4 addresses for its own purposes it may assign
them to itself from the available addresses. If there are no available
addresses then the Hacklab invokes the exhaustion process above.

Whether or not the Hacklab requires addresses for it own purposes is a
decision for the members. It is assumed that the Hacklab will always require
a minimum of 2 addresses for internal use and an additional 2 addresses will
be reserved for technical reasons (the start and end of the block of addresses).


Sale of IPv4 address block
--------------------------

The Hacklab should aim to sell the IPv4 address block at market rates when
IPv4 becomes irrelevant or is about to become irrelevant, as long as the
membership decides that the sale will be of more benefit to the lab than the
addresses are.

The intention is to recover the cost of the original resource when it is no
longer required before its value drops, not to make a profit. The majority
of active members with assignments must approve the sale because it would be
unfair to sell it while it's still actively in use.
