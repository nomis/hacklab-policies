IPv4 Addresses
==============

The Hacklab has an assignment of IPv4 addresses. These are a limited resource
and were expensive to obtain. The original cost for a block of 256 IP addresses
was £X.


Assignment to members
---------------------

Members may receive an allocation of 1 IPv4 address for a non-refundable one-off fee
of £Y (£X / 256). Members may not receive additional allocations.

This allocation is perpetual unless the member is expelled, but it is only fulfilled
with an assignment of an IPv4 address while their membership is active.

It is intentional that this may result in the over-comitting of available addresses,
provided some members let their current membership period expire.

Members may opt not to use their allocation, freeing up the assignment of an address
without needing to suspend their membership.

Additional addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Members may receive an additional assignment of IPv4 addresses for a recurring fee
of £Z (£Y / 24) per address per month, as long as there are available addresses to
assign.


Exhaustion of available addresses
---------------------------------

If there are no available addresses and the assignment of an allocation is
required, then the members with the most additional addresses (or volunteers with
additonal addresses) will be given N months notice to return additional addresses
to meet the assignment need.

If there are no additional addresses that could be returned then it is possible
to perform a transfer of an allocation between members.

Allocation transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Members may transfer their allocation of 1 IPv4 address to another member who
does not have an allocation. Allocations may not be transferred unless the
exhaustion condition above is met. Allocations may not be transferred unless the
member's allocation is currently fulfilled with an assignment (it must result
in the assignment being moved).

Fees involved for a transfer are a matter between the members concerned.


Assignment to the Hacklab
-------------------------

When the Hacklab requires IPv4 addresses for its own purposes it may assign
them to itself from the available addresses. If there are no available
addresses then the Hacklab invokes the exhaustion process as if it were a
member and is permitted to buy back allocations for their original cost.

To be explicitly clear: the Hacklab cannot buy allocations back from members
unless all of the addresses are assigned to members with allocations or the
Hacklab's own purposes. The intention is that the Hacklab will always attempt
to recover the cost of the resource from the members that want to use it.

Whether or not the Hacklab requires addresses for it own purposes is a
decision for the members. It is assumed that the Hacklab will always require
a minimum of 2 addresses for internal use and an additional 2 addresses will
be reserved for technical reasons (the start and end of the block of addresses).


Sale of IPv4 address block
--------------------------

The Hacklab should aim to sell the IPv4 address block at market rates when
IPv4 becomes irrelevant or is about to become irrelevant, as long as the
membership decides that the sale will be of more benefit to the lab than the
addresses are.

Members will not be entitled to a refund of fees for their allocations.

The intention is to recover the cost of the original resource when it is no
longer required before its value drops, not to make a profit. The majority
of active members with assigned allocations must approve the sale because
it would be unfair to sell it while it's still actively in use.
